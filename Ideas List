Put ideas here, I'll slowly add ideas brought up in the chat too.

Add an arousal bar that forces you to either fuck enemies or get a penalty from masturbating on the go. (maybe search for a stamina mod for a headstart)
Tie specific animations/transformations to items (growth hormones that increase butt and bust size)
ANIMATIONS, we need 'em (doing a main, reusable animation first, then expanding into specialised anims later)
Items to help with sex or change sex anims. (Collars, BDSM Gear, Whip?)
'Her burden' integration/inclusion with author's permission (The giant dildo)
Pick up smaller monsters and fuck them as you go with a movement speed penalty
Sexable items. (Onahole, Her Burden, Item Waifus?)
Changing certain thematics to imply some level of consensual sex (tri-tipped daggers to viagra(viagra might be an issue due to IP n shizz))
How would sex with bosses work?
Unique drops from fucking
'Death' animations where creature claim you as their plaything
Spawn an interactible on enemy death (Spawning an interactible on death may cause clutter from all the bodies on the ground, especially if you don't move around quickly or keep circling back)
Have a fail safe for normal animations
Allow room for mod creators to create custom animations
Make a 'SexMod Prefab' that has everything we need and attach it onto the characters instead of actually like, changing the characters directly
Unity might have an animation retargeting system plugin somewhere ("Note w/ retargeting it only works with unity "humanoid" skeletons iirc. so if there are ANY extra/missing bones then things get fucky")
Expand on that egg/tentacle mod? (suspicious tentacle?)
Futa and/or Male compatibility (Not necessarily futa on male)
On pregnancy: you have to protect the npc or player for a while until birthing a minion and the minion gets half your items, cloned and half of the other person/npc
"Does this mod need to be networked so it works in multi-player?" "Probably yes"


Helpful leads:
"I mean paladin has dance moves that trigger unique animations"
"If you could figure out how they change the model with heretic you could probably add a transform based on an equation that scales part of the model"
"To trigger the animations, shamelessly -s-t-e-a-l- borrow the concept of Aphrodite's bow from starbound"
